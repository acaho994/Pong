# Pong

This is a PONG game program I designed for an assignment through "Interactive Programming in Python" on coursera.com

The program uses libraries that are specific to the online python terminal, codeskulptor.org

For optimal use, go to http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user44_VlcSvp9kfMg1LSK.py

I do not claim to own any part of codeskulptor, coursera, or PONG.
